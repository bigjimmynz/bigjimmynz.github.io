# DrivenByDevOps Blog

This is the repo for my blog on Cloud Infrastructure and DevOps things.

It is using github pages and jekyll to run. With a modified midnight theme and jekyll-now.

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.
