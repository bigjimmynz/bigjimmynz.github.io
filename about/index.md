Welcome to a tech blog about automation, Continuous delivery/integration, DevOps, SysOps,
monitoring, security, and anything else I do in my job.

I am James, a DevOps Technical Consultant based in Auckland, New Zealand. My background is as
a SysAdmin, but I now specialise in Automation, Orchestration, CI/CD, and overall DevOps with self-hosted and cloud infrastructure.

My current focus is to help teams and organisations advance their systems building and management
with automation. Constructing and deploying infrastructure with automated processes accelerates
the speed at which you can deploy systems, but also allows you do this reliably, repeatedly,
decreasing the chance of human error. Infrastructure as code allows the testing of system deployments and will allow SysAdmin teams the time to focus on improvements to the infrastructure rather than fire fighting day-to-day problems.

Over the time of my career I have spent many on-call hours and nights debugging systems and
fixing problems due to config changes and differences. I am passionate about automation as a
process and workflow to improve overall systems management and well-being. Teams or individuals
should not be mired down in fixing configs.

This blog is to document items I have been working on or discovered over the the course of
projects. Hopefully it can help people. I am all about disseminating knowledge.

Outside of work I keep myself busy with cars, motorcycles, motorsport, guitar playing, and RPG/tabletop games. I also delve into electronics hackery, with PC and VR gaming when I can find the time.
